    However, this is a different 
    location from the spot where I grew up, which is Marshfield, MA, USA.

        To the left is an image at my favorite place, which is my home.
    My home is my favorite place because it is the place I am most comfortable,
    and it is where some of my favorite people are: my parents, and my dog!
